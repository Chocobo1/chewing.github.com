libchewing 0.8.0 Released: 2024-05-14

What's New in libchewing 0.8.0
---------------------------------------------------------

**BREAKING CHANGE**

New dictionary format is not compatible with old tools. Existing user dictionary
will be automatically backed up and migrated however old tools might not be able
to manipulate the dictionary directly.

The `chewing-editor` program can still be used to edit user dictionaries. In
this release we also introduced a new `chewing-cli` tool to inspect/dump/build
user dictionaries. See `chewing-cli(1)` for more details.

This version also closed/fixed many issues. Find the complete list of closed
issues here: https://github.com/chewing/libchewing/milestone/7?closed=1
